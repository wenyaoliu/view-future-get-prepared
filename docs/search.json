    "section": "",
    "text": "When I was young, studying in a village primary school, I concentrated on ‚Äî whether self-motivated or forced by my parents ‚Äî studying only two subjects, Math and Chinese language. Later in middle school, the number of subjects have increased from two to nine, with the addition of English, Science, Physics, Chemistry, History, Geometry, and Ideological or Moral. Some classmates felt difficult but I kept them to be just courses. I achieved good grades following the same strategy by listening carefully on classes, understanding the definitions and practicing on some typical problems. Thanks to this strategy and devotional work, I was always in the top 1 or 2 among my peers and had achieved nice grades in Gaokao, a nationwide college entrance exam in China, similar to SAT in the U.S., but hold only one time and is generally only open to Grade 12. I was regarded as intelligent and admitted to college.\nThings changed after I went to college, Hunan University, located in Changsha, China. I moved from the village or county high school to the province (just like state in the U.S.) capital. It resembles, though I haven‚Äôt realized at that time, the ending of an undisturbed, private-centered and study-only school life. Hunan University is one of the first-class universities in China and it is famous not only for its academic reputation but also for its open campus. Although in the U.S. universities were often wall surrounded, it is rare in China for a high level university to distribute its buildings in the city with roads, shops and city residents interspersed. Studying on an open campus with classmates from different parts of China, changing to the various city living styles, and dealing with complex college courses, I came to be wondering why people are different, the meaning of life, how to succeed, what to do in the future and what should I learn now.\nThe mystification about the future and present drove me to continue studying for a master‚Äôs degree when I graduate, to quit a nice job in Hunan Architecture Design Institute, and to pursue a Ph.D.¬†degree in the U.S. I made these decisions not because I was fully considered, but because the saying of others and the trend of the peers. These decisions seem intelligent for most people but not excellent as we expected. The sorrows behind the glorious ‚Äúhighly educated oversea‚Äù is hard to describe but can be painful when a man got separated from his parents, lover, relatives and friends for more than three years, not voluntarily but forced by invisible walls due to the COVID 19 pandemic and international political conflicts.\nHowever, when I look back on these decisions after getting through the sorrows and pains, there is always a logic deep in my mind, that is to learn something and keep learning when wondering which way to go. This logic brings the things learned in mind, while not necessarily bringing wealth or fortune, but at least has a lower chance of making mistakes."

    "text": "Here is the problem‚Ä¶\nThe problem is there are always many things to learn. All I need to learn before university is on the courses. After that, I confronted so many things to learn, either necessary, useful, amazing or interesting. For example, how to cook and eat healthily, how to dress, where to rent a cost-effective apartment, how to transport by train or plane, how to buy and fix cars, how to communicate with others, how to collaborate with people or manage a task, why economics works in this way, what is behind the politics, what is behind the data, whether the stock is increasing, how to make a blog, how to make videos and earn from posts, how Luffy is going to beat Kaido and win the one-piece, how the Marvel universe absorbed Chinese elements‚Ä¶ So many things to learn!\nBut the time and energy of one person are always limited. I realized myself easily distracted by the idea to study something ‚Äúnot important‚Äù when doing something ‚Äúimportant‚Äù. Sometimes it gets even more annoying when the ‚Äúnot important‚Äù is more interesting üòÇ. In fact, for a long time, I was criticized by true friends saying that I have a lot of ideas but not digging deep into one specific area. I thank my friends for they true words and nice advice, but it is still really confusing as the ‚Äúunimportant‚Äù for the present may change to ‚Äúimportant‚Äù. We may find a lot of such examples in history or life experiences that the unexpected popping idea, ‚Äúunimportant‚Äù skills, and ‚Äúimpolite‚Äù talks brought out innovations or chances. So here comes the question, is there a unifying decision principle or decision system in mind that can tell us why and what should I do now?"

    "text": "The meaning of life\nAlmost everyone comes up with these questions as they grow up: where are we from? what do I live for? what is the meaning of my life? Then we read books, get talks, or do something that can give us the answer or prove our life is meaningful. The answer may vary from religious belief, political faith, prophetic destiny, determined dreams, or developed interests. I saw some people believing they are chosen to protect the weak, some fighting for power, some earning money for family happiness, some for the environment, some for the education‚Ä¶\nThere is no subject rule that one‚Äôs meaning is more meaningful than the other. Everyone, including those who have no idea about the meaning of life, has the same rights and all have the chance to live life to their end. The thing is that the meaning of life should and can only be defined by oneself, even the one is persuaded or motivated. This is the first equality: everyone can control their mind and make their own decisions."

    "text": "The major difference\nThe other equal is the equality in front of time. The billionaire and the poor, the powerful and the ordinary, the beauty and the ugly all have the same 24 hours for one day and 60 minutes for one hour. However, people born similarly can live a different life when it comes to end. And people born differently may live a similar life when they are getting old. Why? What is making the difference? It‚Äôs the decisions and the efforts. Specifically, its the view of the future that makes people make decisions, and the preparation for the future are regarded as efforts.\nLots of examples can be used for illustrating this view. Take the stock market as an example, what makes the difference is your view on the future of one stock and how to buy and sell it, either in the long run or in the short term. As an extreme example for the long run, a little-known John born in a poor family can become a millionaire if he bought 10 dollars of BitCoin in 2010. A well-known billionaire Mike may go broke if he bought BitCoin in December 2021.\nThe praised qualities and preferred conditions are always correlated with the view of the future and the ability to get prepared. For example, honesty. People tend to not do business with those lying because we view a higher risk of being cheated and lower certainty about the future. Or, punctuality. Punctual people are praised because their partners get easier to view the future, and they proved their capability in preparation. Or, wisdom. The wisdom in analyzing the past and revealing the principles behind the surface behaviors or phenomena are believed to provide the power on predicting the future. In the cinema, people love the magic stories and valiant heroes because they either view the future or worked very hard to get things prepared for the future they want it to be. Outside the screen, the rich, clever, and powerful people are more attractive in most circumstances because they are believed to have a clearer view of the future and more reliable preparation, though the fact may not be not so."

I suggest that you take point 2 and build your own framework in point 3. But if allowed, I would attempt in providing some references.
