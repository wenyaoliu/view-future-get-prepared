    "text": "When I was young, studying in a village primary school, I concentrated on — whether self-motivated or forced by my parents — studying only two subjects, Math and Chinese language. Later in middle school, the number of subjects have increased from two to nine, with the addition of English, Science, Physics, Chemistry, History, Geometry, and Ideological or Moral. Some classmates felt difficult but for me they kept to be just courses. I achieved good grades following the same strategy by listening carefully on classes, understanding the definitions and practicing on some typical problems. Thanks to this strategy and devotional working, I was always the top 1 or 2 among the same years and had been regarded as clever boy.\nThings changed after I went to college, Hunan University, locating in Changsha, China. I moved from the village or county high school to the province (just like state in the U.S.) capital. It resembles, though I haven’t realized at that time, the ending of a undisturbed, private-centered and study-only school life. Hunan University is one of the first class universities in China and it is famous not only for its academic reputation but also its open campus. Although in the U.S. universities were often wall surrounded, it is rare in China for a high level university to distribute its buildings in the city with roads, shops and city residents interspersed. Studying in a open campus with classmates from different parts of China, changing to the various city living styles, and dealing complex college courses, I came to be wondering why people are different, the meaning of life, how to succeed, what to do in the future and what should I learn now.\nThis mystification about the future and present drove me to continue studying for master degree when I graduate, quit from a nice job in Hunan Architecture Design Institute, and pursue PhD degree in the U.S. I made these decisions not because I was fully considered, but because the saying of others and the trend of the peers. These decisions seem intelligent for most people but in fact not excellent as we expected. The sorrows behind the glorious “highly educated oversea” are hard to describe but can be really painful when a man got separated with his parents, lover, relatives and friends for more than three years, not voluntarily but forced by invisible walls due to the COVID 19 pandemic and international political conflicts.\nHowever, when I look back on these decisions after getting through the sorrows and pains, I found there is always a logic deep in my mind, that is learn something and keep learning when not"
